Overview:

Predicting the performance level of cars is an important and interesting problem which is faced a lot lately by people. 
Our aim is to predict the performance of the car to improve certain behaviours of the vehicle by predicting. 
This will significantly help to improve the system's fuel consumption and increase efficiency.
The performance analysis of the car is based on the engine type, no of engine cylinders, fuel type, horsepower, etc(which is of the dataset that we are using) 
It is an ongoing process of obtaining, researching, analyzing, and recording health based on the above three factors.
The performance objectives like mileage, dependability, flexibility and cost can be grouped together to play a vital role in 
the prediction engine and engine management system.
